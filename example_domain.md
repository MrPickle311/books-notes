## Example Domain: WolfDesk
WolfDesk provides a help desk tickets management system as a service. If your start-up company needs to provide support to your customers, with WolfDesk’s solution you can get up and running in no time.

WolfDesk uses a different payment model than its competitors. Instead of charging a fee per user, it allows the tenants to set up as many users as needed, and the tenants are charged for the number of support tickets opened per charging period. There is no minimum fee, and there are automatic volume discounts for certain thresholds of monthly tickets: 10% for opening more than 500 tickets, 20% for opening more than 750 tickets, and 30% for opening more than 1,000 tickets per month.

To prevent tenants from abusing the business model, WolfDesk’s ticket lifecycle algorithm ensures that inactive tickets are closed automatically, encouraging customers to open new tickets when further support is needed. Moreover, WolfDesk implements a fraud detection system that analyzes messages and detects cases of unrelated topics being discussed in the same ticket.

To help its tenants streamline the support-related work, WolfDesk has implemented a “support autopilot” feature. The autopilot analyzes new tickets and tries to automatically find a matching solution from the tenant’s ticket history. The functionality allows for further reducing the tickets’ lifespans, encouraging customers to open new tickets for further questions.

WolfDesk incorporates all the security standards and measures to authenticate and authorize its tenants’ users and also allows tenants to configure a single sign-on (SSO) with their existing user management systems.

The administration interface allows tenants to configure the possible values for the tickets’ categories, as well as a list of the tenant’s products that it supports.

To be able to route new tickets to the tenant’s support agents only during their working hours, WolfDesk allows the entry of each agent’s shift schedule.

Since WolfDesk provides its service with no minimal fee, it has to optimize its infrastructure in a way that minimizes the costs of onboarding a new tenant. To do that, WolfDesk leverages serverless computing, which allows it to elastically scale its compute resources based on the operations on active tickets.
